To create a new view controller, click on File->New->File. You should name the view controller related to the content of the view controller. For example, a Twitter application might have a `TimelineViewController`, a `UserViewController`, and a `SettingsViewController`.

If you are **not** using Storyboard, make sure that "With XIB for user interface" is checked. If you are using Storyboard, make sure that it is unchecked. If you've accidentally checked it, you can always delete the .xib file afterwards.

### Step 2: Organizing within groups

In XCode, the folder structure within your project directory doesn't matter. Instead, you organize your files using "Groups" within XCode.
