#### Connecting an IBOutlet

If you want to access an object that you created in Interface Builder, you have to create an IBOutlet. For example, if you have a UILabel in the xib, and you want to set the text of the label in code, create an outlet for the UILabel. Click on the tuxedo in the upper right to open the Assistant Editor which puts the xib and code files next to each other. Make sure you control-click in order to draw the line for the outlet.
