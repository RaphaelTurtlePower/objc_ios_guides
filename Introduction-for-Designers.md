## Introduction to iOS for Designers

This bootcamp is optimized for empowering designers to modify the view and animation related code for production features. As such, there is a focus on views, navigation, transitions, and animations. Topics such as networking, threading, models, and device frameworks for accessing the camera and location are not covered. In addition, there is a focus on techniques currently used in production such as programmatic views and springs and struts over Interface builder and Auto Layout.

In terms of prototyping, the goal of the class is to provide the tools necessary to build rich, interactive mocks using Objective-C instead of Quartz Composer and other tools. While the bootcamps will not cover enough topics to make the prototypes fully functional, that would be the logical next step.
