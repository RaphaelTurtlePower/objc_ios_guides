Notifying Instructors for Review
Once you have completed all required user stories and added a README described above when you are ready to notify us that you have completed the project and are ready for an instructor review, create an "Issue" on the GitHub repository for your project repository in the "Issues" tab on the site by going to the main page for that repo, selecting the "Issues" tab and then select "New issue".



Here is an example of an issue that you will create for us to review. Make sure to mention our names in the issue by typing "/cc @nesquena @timothy1ee" in the body of the issue. Include [iOS Bootcamp] in the issue title to ensure we can find the review request. We will then review your submission and respond in the issue with feedback. Please also include your name either in your Github profile or in the issue so we can link you back to your work.
