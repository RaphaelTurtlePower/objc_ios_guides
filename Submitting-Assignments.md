## Create a GitHub Repository

For this course, you need a GitHub account which is free to signup. GitHub is an excellent version control system that makes sharing and collaborating on code as easy as possible. We will be submitting all assignments using GitHub and sharing all our code through GitHub. 

If you do not have a Github account, [sign up here](https://github.com/signup/free) and then you begin [creating free repositories](https://github.com/new). Create a new repository for each project you want to push to GitHub.

## Creating the Project README

In your project repository, add a file named README.md at the root. Required elements to include in the README for the project (see example):

- How many hours did it take to complete?
- Which required and optional stories have you completed?
- GIF walkthrough of all required and optional stories (using LICEcap)

Please note that you need to [download LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) and you MUST include a GIF walkthrough of all required and optional stories in the README such as:

## Notifying Instructors for Review

Once you have completed all required user stories and added a README described above when you are ready to notify us that you have completed the project and are ready for an instructor review, create an "Issue" on the GitHub repository for your project repository in the "Issues" tab on the site by going to the main page for that repo, selecting the "Issues" tab and then select "New issue".

Here is an example of an issue that you will create for us to review. Make sure to mention our names in the issue by typing "/cc @nesquena @timothy1ee" in the body of the issue. Include [iOS Bootcamp] in the issue title to ensure we can find the review request. We will then review your submission and respond in the issue with feedback. Please also include your name either in your Github profile or in the issue so we can link you back to your work.
