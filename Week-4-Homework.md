- The homework this week is to make an interactive mock of a simplified Paper "Edit Sections" page. Read the required and optional items below.
  - In the menu, tapping "Edit Sections" should show the EditSectionsViewController.
  - In Edit Sections, tapping Done should show Headlines view. In other words, you should still be on the menu.
  - On pan up of the Headlines Card, Facebook Card animates to the left, drop area appears, and Headlines Card scales up.
  - Upon releasing from a pan,
    - If the card is above a threshold, snap Headlines Card to drop area
    - If the card is below a threshold, snap Headline Card to origin
  - When the Headlines Card is below, double tapping it snaps it to drop area
  - Facebook card should wobble (optional)
  - When Headlines Card is next to the Facebook Card, it should also wobble (optional)
  - Dragging the headline should cause the headline card to swing around the drag point with gravity (optional)
- Group project
  - Create high fidelity versions of your mocks.
