- The homework this week is to make an interactive mock of a simplified Paper "Edit Sections" page. Read the required and optional items below.
  - In the menu, tapping "Edit Sections" should show the EditSectionsViewController.
  - In Edit Sections, tapping Done should show Headlines view. In other words, you should still be on the menu.
  - On pan up of the Headlines Card, Facebook Card animates to the left, drop area appears, and Headlines Card scales up.
  - Upon releasing from a pan,
    - If the card is above a threshold, snap Headlines Card to drop area
    - If the card is below a threshold, snap Headline Card to origin
  - When the Headlines Card is below, double tapping it snaps it to drop area
  - Facebook card should wobble (optional)
  - When Headlines Card is next to the Facebook Card, it should also wobble (optional)
  - Dragging the headline should cause the headline card to swing around the drag point with gravity (optional)
- Group project
  - Implement view controllers placeholders for each screen. The purpose is to set up the basic navigation and structure of the application. It's also easier to collaborate if you have all the view controllers set up.
  - Implement any table views in your application. See [[Working with UITableView]]. If you run out of time, you can use screenshots of the table view with tap gesture recognizers to capture taps on the cell.
